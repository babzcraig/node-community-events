# node-community-events
The 6th of a series of 10 projects in node that I am currently working on.

The aim of this is to be solid with NodeJS. Node is Javascript's answer to server side development and an awesome tool for creating fast, lightweight and scalable web applications.

It's been fun so far so let's have this continue!

This project will allow a community of users set up and sign up for events.

It will utilize several node modules such as drywall, bcrypt, mongodb and grunt.
